      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <b>Olai</b>. I enjoy programming in my free time, and I am
        passionate about Linux, computers, and open source software.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite technologies include <b>NixOS</b>, <b>Rust</b>,
        <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>LaTeX</b>, and more recently
        <b>Functional programming languages</b> such as
        <b>Haskell</b> and <b>Nix</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love configuring my systems to work exactly how I want them to, using <b
          >Linux</b
        > to customize every aspect of my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently in school, and aspire to become a <i
          ><b>software engineer</b></i
        > in the future.
